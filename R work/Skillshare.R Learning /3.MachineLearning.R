#What is machine learning?
#learning based on gathered information is machine learning
#this learning allows it to make intelligent predictions

#machine derives logic based on presented information(data).

#idea???
#idea that computer can build "logic" based on the presented data 

#e.g. Youtube
#Youtube gathers information (data) using your search history.
#this allows it to make intelligent predictions about what next you be interested in.

#e.g. classification algorithm : 
#that puts data into different groups.
#for instance, classifying emails into spam and non-spam
#this is done by detecting certain buzzwords
#But those buzzwords are different some times
#so machine learns each time the buzzword is added or altered.


#Machine learning??
#algorithms are created that can spot trends/patterns
#to learn from those patterns.
#this way algorithms become more intelligent in learning new information
#more like self evolving - salient being("used by Google engineer")


#what are algorithms??
#things required to obtain an output
#think of algos as functions (remember Udemy course - 
#what a functions was doing, it was taking inputs to get an output)

#e.g. you wish to add two numbers
#step1 : declare the inputs (num1 and num2)
#step2: use + operator (as you need to add those two numbers)
#num1 + num2 is an algorithm
