#extrapolating 
#think of extrapolations as predictions
#it means inference(prediction) derived from presented information,BUT
#this prediction may not be as accurate as it is 'outside' the presented range.

#e.g. you have equation of a line y=mx+c (m is the slope and c is the intercept)
#interpolation-is to finding something new that is close to that line (higher chances to be accurate)
#extrapolation - is finding something new that is 'far away' from the line (less chances to be accurate)

#Data scientist study Big data to:
#to draw insights.
#They may extrapolate based on their insights to solve complex problems

#.....skills
#their job uses computer modeling, math, statistics, and business knowledge

#Challenges
#obtain data
#work with unstructured data
#processing Big bulky data

#role of data engineers:
#Obtaining data and cleaning and 
#organizing data into structured format

#Role of business Intelligence Specialists
#Identify trends in data sets

#difference between data scientists and data analyst
#Data science develop algorithms/functions that help in modeling data.

#Data analyst - use available algos to examine the data sets to identify trends and
#reach meaningful insights
