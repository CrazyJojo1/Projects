#repeat loop is unique to R

#In R you have three types of loops:
#repeat loop
#while loop
#for loop
#you don't need loop for Data science
#instead you use apply family functions or a package called Purrr

#Functions
#packages
# important functions for packages:
#install.package("name of package you want to install")
#installed.packages() -gives you list of packages that you have installed
#remove.packages() -
#old.packages() - gives you list of outdated packages. so you may want to update those packages

#update.packages()
#library()- activate a package
#detach() - remove package from the local environment, but package remains installed
old.packages()

#tip:
#if your code needs specific packaged and 
#you are sending someone your code

#make sure: at the very top of your code
#you have install.packages("package name") and library(package name)
