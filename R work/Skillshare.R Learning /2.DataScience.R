#Digital data?
#A 2013 study found that digital data started mostly around 2011.
#meaning most of the data analysis started since 2011.
#So its been more than a decade that we are processing data.
#which means availability of digital data is way more than ever.

#.................
#What is Data Science?
#Data science allows you to break down this digital clutter(raw data) into some
#useful information
#This derived useful information(trends, patterns, foresights) can help businesses, economist, or 
#any kind of that requires forecasting.

#Data Science uses data for real-world application
#converting data into better overall decisions in general is data science.

#............e.g
#you are working for Zomato
#data you have:
#data set of a customer from a particular region

#What can you use this data for?/
#their buying behaviour
#What these customers are buying and when(days, time of the day)
#which restaurants, and dishes are in craze
#probability of them to buy when they place their item on the cart
#does festivals trigger a massive sell-off
#max and min. and average spending by the customers

#So using this data.... what can Zomato do?
#Have exclusive contracts with restaurants that are in craze..
#this will allow seamless flow of orders and customer satisfaction
#preparing order as soon as they put it on cart.... if probability of their buying is high
#Festivals - make special discounts or increase delivery agents.
#may be opening additional cloud restaurants in order to minimize delay during festives
#max., min and average.... will allow company to budget their expenditure
#this can make operations more productive 
#and increase company's bottom-line(net profit) which is (Gross revenue-expense)

#............main things data scientist look for ??
#1. identifying your problem and them looking for a cause of that problem
#these problems could be identified by building connections using raw data

#skills used by data scientist?
#data engineering
#math
#statistics
#advanced computing visualizations
#communication skills- e.g. able to explain it to your boss 
#what you got effectively so that he can use your work 
#to derive something useful
#Goal is to increase your company's bottom-line

#lastly, patience

#...................5 key steps involved in data science?
#1. Acquiring data
#2. data storage - think of it as a 'Data Warehouse' (using SQL)
#3. Processing - Mining, clustering/classification, modeling , data summarization 
#4. Analyzing - regression, qualitative analysis, how it can benefit 
#5. Communicate - Reporting what your data says
