#why are all the lines copied from 'script environment' to console
#this means you can write code in console itself without the need to write in R script environment.
#R studio just provides you can option to reduce the clutter console has.
#In script environment, you just have your script (neat), while results and errors appear in console.


#let's run the script or code in console rather than in script environment

#in console, you don't need to press Run. just enter will run your command.
#so running code in console is quick. But you won't be able to SAVE your code

# you can think of R studio (script environment where I am writing) as a shell on top of R (R is console section)
# shell it means. R (console) takes the code from R studio and copies it on Console and runs it for you.
# this way you command console what code it should run.
