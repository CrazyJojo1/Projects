plot(FieldGoals/FieldGoalAttempts)

plot(Preference.Style)
#If you exclude free throws, then you can either score a 
#2 pointer or 3-pointer
#since average lies between 2 and 3
#It makes sense for our data to lie between 2 and 2.35

#JoeJohnson
#his points scored lie between 2.2 and 2.35. This shows, on average, he is more of a 3 pointer player
#Chris Paul started off as a 2 pointer, but now is more on the 3 pointer side.
#DwightHoward is a 2 pointer player and has been consistently playing this style for the last 10 years



#Conclusion:
#Chris Paul has highest accuracy, but gets minimum
#number of free throws
#So, if her could get more free throws then it may work well for the team.
#DwightHoward good in field goals, but poor in free throws.
#Data also tells that most of his play is close to the net...this could be the reason as to why he doesn't do 3 pointers
#DwightHowrd, although superb at what he does, is not too good away from the net when it comes to scoring a fieldGoal.
