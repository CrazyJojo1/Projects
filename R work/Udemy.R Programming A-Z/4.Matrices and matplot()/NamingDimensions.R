#naming dimensions

#create a vector using rep() function
e <- rep(27,15)
e
#create a matrix
H <- matrix(e,3,5)
H

#you want to select 1st row
H[1,]
#what will you could name [1,] in to something like letter 'p'

#naming dimensions means giving names to columns and rows
#e.g. row1 is called jack, row2 is called john and row3 is called johnny. etc.
#same is for columns

#let's see how we can do that?


#in order to reach to a specific element in a matrix
#A[3,4] is used to call element from a matrix A present in 3rd row and 4th column
#Syntax :-
#name of the matrix[row_name, col_name]

#naming rows and columns
