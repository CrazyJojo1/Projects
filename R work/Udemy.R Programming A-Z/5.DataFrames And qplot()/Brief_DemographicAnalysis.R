#.csv means comma separated values
#Internet usage data is presented in percentage
#data is for 2012
#Birth rate - per thousand people, how many new borns per year per country
#e.g. 10.244 means in a sample of 1000 people, close to 10 new individual were born in that year.

#Change in population = people immigrating - people emigrating
