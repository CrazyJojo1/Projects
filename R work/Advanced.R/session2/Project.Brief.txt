#you need to investigate one of the heavy machines - RL1

#Data is for one month
#it shows what percentage capacity of each machine was idle (unused) in a given hour
#You need to deliver an R list with the following components:

#1. machine name - single character vector
#2. (min, mean , max) utilization for the month (exclude unknown hours) - numeric vector
#3. has utilization even fallen below 90%? - logical vector
#4. find hours where utilization is unknown (NA's) - numeric vector (use subsetting and is.na())
#5. Build data-frame for "RL1 machine" - Data-Frame
#6. Plot for "all" the machines - Plot
