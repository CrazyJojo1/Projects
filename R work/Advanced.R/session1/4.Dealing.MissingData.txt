How to deal with Missing Data

1st Approach:- Predict with 100% Accuracy
#e.g. Profit is missing. but you have data for revenue and expense
#profit = revenue - expenses

2nd Approach:-leave record as is
#Leave the cell empty.
#Do this if that column with missing data is not important for your analysis

3rd Approach :- Remove record entirely
#Remove that entire row.
#cons: it will decrease the number of observations(rows)

4th Approach(approach used in this course) :- Replace with mean or median
#median is preferred over mean as median is less affected by outliers.

5th Approach :- Fill in by exploring correlations and similarities

6th Approach :- Introduce dummy variable for "Missingness"

5th and 6th approach are advanced approaches and will not be covered in this course.
