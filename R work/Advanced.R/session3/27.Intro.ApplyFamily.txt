1. Apply family function is a shortcut to running loops in R
2. And it is unique to R.... no other programming languages will make use of it.

What does Apply family does?
- it applies a 'function' to an 'object' in R.

1. object can be a list, a matrix, a data-frame or a vector for instance.
2. function that you can apply have their own use case.... will be discussed later in this course.

Why was Apply Family created in R??
- R is specific to statisticians and later became part of Data-Science.
- So Apply Family functions get rid of loops and makes it easy to work with bigdata.

- Instead of Loops, you use this shortcuts (apply family functions)
