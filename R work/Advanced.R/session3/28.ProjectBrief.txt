                      Weather Patterns - Project Brief

- You are working on a project for a meterology bureau. 
- You have been supplied weather data fro 4 cities in US : Chicago, NewYork, Houston, and SanFrancisco.
 
-You are required to deliver the following outputs: 
1. A table with annual averages of each observed metric for every city. - 
solution - (to find annual average, you would need to sum the averages of each month/12)

2. A table showing : How much temperature fluctuates each month from min to max.(in %)
solution -(find the temperature difference. Take min. temperature as the base.
To calculate this find (min-max)/min - you are basically calculating the relative fluctuation in temperature w.r.t. the minimum temperature.)

3. A table showing the annual maximums of each observed metric for every city.

4. A table showing the annual minimums of each observed metric for every city.

5. A table showing in which months the annual maximums of each metric were observed in every city 

how to create a (째) in R - (use option + shift + 8 to add degree sign)

What do you see in your data
- you have 째C - european (metric system)
- and you have same data in 째F - American (imperical system)

We have five metric
- avg. temperature high for each month 
- avg. temperature low for each month
- avg. rainfall(mm) in each month
- How many days in a given month experienced rainfall
- how many hours of sunshine was observed for each month.

In this project.... we will be using 째F charts

Where has the Data come from?
- Data is for 30 year timeline
- Data for Chicago, Houston and San Francisco were measured from 1980-2010(30 yr.)
- New York was from 1960 - 1990 (30 yr.)

So avg. reading for temperature, rainfall is the average for that 30 year time-lin and they calcualted average based on months
- e.g. for 30 years, January avg. temp high was .......... and so on...
- e.g. how many rainy days on average were experienced in the month of Dec for a time-period of 30 years
