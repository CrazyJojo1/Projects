                      functions in APPLY FAMILY
1. apply 
- use on matrix either on the rows or on the columns. examples-
apply(M,1,mean)#for rows
apply(M,2,mean)#for columns

2. tapply 
- it is used on a vector to extract subgroups and apply a function to them

3. by
- use on data frames. Same concept as in group by in SQL

4. epply
- use on an environment(E)

5. lapply
- apply a function to elements of a list (L)

6. sapply
- a version of lapply. Can simplify (S) the result so it's not presented as a list.
- the result of sapply is presented as a vector or a matrix (but not as a list)

7. vapply
- has a pre-specified type of return value(V)

8. replicate
-used to run a funciton several times. Usually used with generation of random variables
- don't confuse it with rep() 

9. mapply()
- multivariate (M) version of sapply. Arguments can be recycled

10. rapply
- recursive (R) version of lapply

What we will study in this course?
1. apply
2. lapply
3. sapply
These are the best to get started and cover all the basics that are very likely used in other apply functions.
