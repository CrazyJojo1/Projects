    "# What is Git?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a version control system that allows you to make incremental changes to your file (code file). And, It gives you the ability to see your old code (anytime anywhere)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Git allows you to write a bunch of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- collaboration tool  \n",
    "The code written by you can be looked at by others (if settings is public) and also other coders can modify that code (add little bit more to it) for good. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It is also a version control tool.\n",
    "    + Gives you backup files\n",
    "        - If you do make a mistake, you can compare your existing code with earlier version of the code to see what is wrong and fix your mistake.\n",
    "    + Keep a history\n",
    "        - Every modification to your code is saved in Git database\n",
    "    + Experiment\n",
    "        - You are use a specific section of code taken from one of Git repositories and experiment with it.\n",
    "        \n",
    "- it is a distributed system\n",
    "The entire project, including all of its history, is mirrored on the person's computer who are collaborating. \n",
    "\n",
    "- it is an open source and is free\n",
    "This means anyone can download the package from Git. And coders can also contribute to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why distributed system is faster?\n",
    "- Speed \n",
    "    - Since you are not using any central server, it takes out the performance of the network out of the equation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- offline access\n",
    "     - All changes you make are saved in your file in your computer. And since file is saved on your computer, you don't need to connected to the network to work on it.\n",

    "\n",
    "**A directory that stores all your project work.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see Issues (problems), Commits (updates that collaborators have made on project), Code language used (what languages are used for that project - python, java, C, txt etc.)\n",

    "### What are commits?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Git is an open source that allows everybody to contribute. When one of the contributor writes a code and packages that code in their or someone-else repository on Github it is called a commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you can say commit is \n",
    "  - **some little update to a large repository.**\n",
    "  - way to travel through a project's history and see codes at different point in time\n",
    "      - **click on (< >), allows you to browse the repo from that point in history.**\n",
    "      This means that you can see what the code looked like at the time when that commit was submitted.\n",
    "  - hash (commits unique identifier)\n",
    "      - a unique hash is given to each commit.\n",
    "      - if you click on the first seven letters (e.g. c165870), then it will take you to the commit\n",
