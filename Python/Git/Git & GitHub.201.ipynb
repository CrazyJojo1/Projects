    "\n",
    "## Brief on what we will cover:\n",
    "- Modern ways to work with other developers\n",
    "- How to contribute to other people's code\n",
    "- General workflow that every developer needs to know in order to work with a team\n",
    "\n",
    "### We will touch\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. GitHub issues\n",
    "2. GitHub pull requests\n",
    "3. Deleting a repo\n",
    "4. How to fork a repo\n",
    "5. Opening a PR from a forked repo\n",
    "```\n",
    "____\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Setting up a project (name: git-essentials)\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow this steps :\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. You create a repo on github.com\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You copy the html code\n",
    "\n",
    "3. go back to your terminal and create a directory - 'Project'\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Once you are in that directory - git clone copied html code\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ls -al Project #This will show your the files present in the Project directory\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's say you made changes in your README.md file by doing the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. open -a Rstudio README.md\n",
    "you can edit your file and press command + S\n",
    "\n",
    "2. git diff README.md\n",
    "This will show you the changes you made in your .md file\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For Staging - \n",
    "git add README.md\n",
    "git commit -m \"updated\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Pushing file to Github.com - \n",
    "git push origin main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Seeing your previous commits \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git status\n",
    "\n",
    "git log --oneline\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want to go back in time - Let's say what did your project looked like when you passed your commit (\"updated\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "step1 - copy the hash for commit (\"updated\")- It will look like (97e61e0) \n",
    "\n",
    "step2- git checkout copied hash\n",
    "`git checkout 97e61e0`\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to detach your file from the rest. \n",
    "\n",
    "step3  git log --oneline\n",
    "(you will see something like - `f33ec9d (HEAD) update`\n",
    "\n",
    "step4 - In order to go back to your main branch \n",
    "`git branch`\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Tip: Don't work in detached mode. It is really good for looking around, but it can cause you a lot of problems if make changes in the detach mode and make a commit.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "step5- to go back to your main branch\n",
    "`git checkout main` \n",
    "```\n",
    "Now you are no longer in detached mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Recap on how to see your previous commits:\n",
    "Follow these five simple steps-\n",
    "1. `git checkout copied hash for specific commit`\n",
    "2. `git log --oneline` #This will change your files to when that commit was placed\n",
    "3. `git branch` #This will give info that you are in detached mode.\n",
    "4. `git checkout main` \n",
    "5. `git branch` #This will provide you info that you are back to main branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Last Thing** - You should always be working on an main branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are issues?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a good way to communicate with the maintainer of a project about what need to be fixed. e.g. If there is a typo\n",
    "\n",
    "To open up an issue. Follow these steps.\n",
    "1. click on issues tab \n",
    "2. click on `New issue`\n",
    "3. add a title (subject) e.g. `Change a typo in your README.md`\n",
    "4. Leave a comment - Comment is a .md file. So feel free to use # for titles and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue is a text file. It has no code in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Role of a Assignee?\n",
    "Who is asked to resolve or look at the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "labels?\n",
    "This gives description to the problem.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can tell whether the given issue is a `bug` (something is not working as expected), `documentation problem` (problem with README.md), `good first issue` and `help wanted`, `question` (feedback is requested).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Benefit of issues? - use it as a reference  \n",
    "If the issue you are experiencing is similar to one of the previous resolved issues, then it can be helpful. e.g. Let's say you had a typo in python package and it was preventing it from working with Jango.   \n",
    "So, first thing you do when you experience a problem is to go to issues tab and search issues and pull request. Type your issue in search tab and press enter.     \n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are branches?\n",
    "\n",
    "A branch is a carbon copy of all of your code present in the `main branch`, but with couple of changes in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "step1- make sure you are on main branch\n",
    "`git branch`\n",
    "\n",
    "step2- to create a new branch \n",
    "`git checkout -b 'new_branch_name'`  #use quotations if your name has spaces in it(e.g. New Branch for 2021)\n",
    "\n",
    "step3- check if the new branch as been created\n",
    "`git branch`\n",
    "\n",
    "step4- let's add a new file in this branch\n",
    "In your file section of Rstudio.. create a text file (New file.txt)\n",
    "\n",
    "step5- open New file.txt and type something\n",
    "This is file from new branch\n",
    "\n",
    "step6- Even though we have added a new branch that contains a text file, git doesnot know about it.\n",
    "In order for git to know,\n",
    "`git status`\n",
    "`git add \"New file.txt\"`  #staging\n",
    "`git commit -m \"New Branch commit\"\n",
    "`git push origin (new branch name)`. #you don't need to use parenthesis \n",
    "\n",
    "#to get back to main branch\n",
    "`git checkout main`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if you check on Github.com, your new branch will be present. **The files that exist in the New Branch will not be present in the main branch**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Benefit of creating a New Branch:- Your Main Branch that contains your main source of code will remain as it is.\n",
    "By creating a new branch you can modify, add files to your main source code without damaging your main branch. This is pretty much what you want when working with multiple people.\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are pull requests (PR)?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Become a contributor\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a way for you to ask the maintainer of a repository to merge some of your code into their work. If your code is merged (i.e. your pull request is accepted), then you become the contributor.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Approving merging\n",
    "\n",
    "When receive a pull request.. you can look at `Files changed`.  \n",
    "You can then `Review changes`--> `Approve`  \n",
    "*Approving doesnot mean merging.* Lastly to merge, `Merge pull request`.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Check if the New Branch is in conflict with the main branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "step1- Create a new pull request by comparing changes across two branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "step2 - Look at number of commits in the New Branch (scroll to the bottom)\n",
    "\n",
    "step3 - add a comment and body, add assignee, label and put a pull request.\n",
    "\n",
    "step4 - click on `pull request` and select your recent pull request.\n",
    "\n",
    "step5 - click on `File changed`\n",
    "\n",
    "step6 - `Review changes`.  (Note: you cannot approve your own pull request)\n",
    "\n",
    "step7 - click on `Conversation` icon and you will see `Merge pull request`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all you need to do put files present in New Branch into main Branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is forking?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you fork a project (a repo), then it will allow you to copy the entire project (line by line) into your account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you fork a repo (it will show something like -`forked from -----`).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now clone this on your computer (covered in Github 101) and this allows you to modify the project any way you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "__In nutshell, forking is creating a copy__\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps you need to follow:-\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. select the project on Github that you want to fork\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Once you on that project on Github, select fork.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Since you will be working on your local computer, you must clone this.\n",
    "`git clone copied_html_code`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. open the repo on your project - cd (path)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Once in the directory that you have cloned - ls\n",
    "\n",
    "6. check the branch you are at - `git branch`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. check which projects you are connected from your github account - `git remote`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note- if you see `origin` as its output, then origin stands for the copied url that you used to clone that repo on to your local computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git remote -v` will show you the copied url as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have copied the url and you are locally connected to it, let's start working\n",
    "\n",
    "- step1: Create a new branch using  `git checkout -b new-branch-demo`\n",
    "\n",
    "- step2: Confiming that you can working at a new branch `git branch`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's overwrite the README.md\n",
    "\n",
    "- step3: After you done editing the README.md, see what changes have you made `git diff README.md`\n",
    "\n",
    "- step4: `git status`\n",
    "\n",
    "- step5: Staging `git add README.md`\n",
    "\n",
    "- step6: `git commit -m \"updated\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- step7: Push this changes to your github account  `git push origin new-branch-demo`\n",
    "\n",
    "- step8: Verify. Go to your Github account and check if the new branch is added to the forked project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- step9: Now go to the original repo (click `forked from CodingForEverybody/7-days-of-wagtail`). **The new branch doesnot exist.** Any thing you do with the forked repo will exist only in your personal account.\n",
    "\n",
    "- step10: Go back to your forked repo and click on where it says 2 branches. Under Your branches, select `New pull request`\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to `Merge new file into Parent repo (from where you forked) or to any other repo`\n",
    "\n",
    "- step11: If you don't want to merge, you can `close pull request`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- step12: If you want to delete your new branch after closing a pull request - `Delete branch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if you go back to your forked repo- you will see that the new branch that you previously created is Deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deleting a repo\n",
    "\n",
    "Let' say you want to delete the forked repo. To do this, go to that forked repo and click setting icon ( present at the top of that screen).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once in the setting page, go all the way to the bottom and you will see `Delete this repository`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will make you copy and paste your path  `CrazyJojo1/7-days-of-wagtail`. This is to confirm that you are delting a forked copy of 7-days-of-wagtail as it has your username (CrazyJojo) attached to it.\n",
    " \n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are gists\n",
    "\n",
    "These are little piece of codes or files that you can share with someone.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create gist - \n",
    "- click on the plus (+) icon that you see next to your profile (top right corner)\n",
    "- select new gist\n",
    "\n",
    "**gist is used to share a bunch of code with someone** . \n",
    "\n",
    "You share gist using url.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to minimum of one file to create a gist. To create new file- click `Add file`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two types of gist\n",
    "1. secret gist \n",
    "\n",
    "Only those who you shared url with will have access to the gist (but are hidden to everyone else.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. public gist\n",
    "\n",
    "Available to everybody.\n",
    "\n",
    "### how to use Url\n",
    "Once you create your gist. you can copy and send that url to someone you want to share it with.   \n",
    "\n",
    "url will look like- [gist](https://gist.github.com/CrazyJojo1/d1295713bb85f3fb3fcd4767ad399ec8)\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "Once you click on the link, you can see the gist. Now, you can either `Embed` this gist in your website or `Download Zip`, this Zip file will have gist code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to edit the gist\n",
    "\n",
    "- Click on `edit`\n",
    "- type to make edit.\n",
    "- click `update gist`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you will have two `Revisions` \n",
    "\n",
    "## Git aliases\n",
    "\n",
    "Aliases allow you to call a function with a short name. e.g. Instead of typing pandas, you can create pd as its alias which can be used in its place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefit of aliases - you need to type less. If your command is too big and you need to use that command too often, it is best to create an alias for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### how to create a git alias?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method1: git config --global alias.shortcut full_function_name\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#creating an alias for git checkout\n",
    "git config --global alias.co checkout\n",
    "#creating an alias for git branch\n",
    "git config --global alias.br branch\n",
    "#now instead of saying\n",
    "git checkout\n",
    "git branch\n",
    "#you can use\n",
    "git co\n",
    "git br\n",
    "```\n",
    "**--global flag means the shortcut can be used for all git repos** \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method2: Directly editing git config file\n",
    "\n",
    "Your home directory will have `.gitconfig` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see, follow this steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Go to your home directory - `cd ~/`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. to see dot files- `ls -a`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once you see .git config file\n",
    "    1. cd .gitconfig\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To open text file, use `cat .gitconfig`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. To edit a text file use vim - `vi .gitconfig`\n",
    "    1. In order to insert, press 'i' key and start typing\n",
    "    2. Once you are done typing, press escape key\n",
    "    3. type `:wq` to write and quit.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[user]\n",
    "\tname = JojoB\n",
    "\temail = rajan.bawa2104@gmail.com\n",
    "[alias]\n",
    "\tbr = branch\n",
    "\tci = commit\n",
    "\tst = status\n",
    "\tco = checkout\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. choose a poject on github that you want to fork.\n",
    "2. get it forked\n",
    "3. clone it to local computer `git clone copied_html_code`\n",
    "4. create new branch - `git checkout -b \"new-branch\"`\n",
    "5. check which branch you are working in - `git branch` (It should be new branch)\n",
    "6. Open one of the files present in master branch and start editing. save changes\n",
    "7. see what changes have been made - `git diff file_name`\n",
    "8. staging - `git add file_name`\n",
    "9. commit - `git commit -m \"project\"`\n",
    "10. push to github - `git push origin new-branch\n",
    "11. #return back to master branch - `git checkout master`\n",
    "12. go to github and do pull request (it will allow you to contribute to the forked project)\n",
