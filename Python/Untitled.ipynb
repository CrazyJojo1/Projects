    "\n",
    "1. Explore data sets both in numeric form and visually using plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Learn how to clean data sets (fix missing and wrong values)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Take different data sets and the combine them by merging, joining, and stacking. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Learn to transform different data sets into different format and pivot data sets. This will allow us to filter data to our need\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Learn how to do vectorize operations \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Manipulate and add features to our data so that it is ready for statistical analysis or for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Pivoting Data is advanced subject.**\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Time series data is used almost in every analysis. e.g. Stock market, temp. history, etc.\n",

    "# What softwares to use-\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Jupyter Notebook (- good for exploratory work - short projects or preliminary work)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter labs\n",
    "- It comes with same functions as the jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "- **It is the file management stuff that is little different than jupyter notebook**; It is an imporvement upon jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It has better way of structuring your files and running them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. PyCharm (- recommended for large projects)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use it when you need to integrate with Git and to work with huge code which require different files to interact with each other.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is used for creating your back-up creation and also, for downloading packages that add additional functionality to your IDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is full fleged IDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "- But, for preliminary analysis jupyter notebook is a good choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It has all of that stuff built in.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has both free and paid version. Free version is all you need. Paid version has additional features that are used in web-server development.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating Backup file system\n",
    "\n",
    "If hardware (your computer or external hard-disk) has crashed, all your useful projects can become unretrievable. So it is very important to have a safe backup place. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Git\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use Git - put all your code on GitHub. Make it public.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. PyCharm\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use PyCharm - Keeps track of your local file history"
