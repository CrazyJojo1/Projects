    "# Nikola Tesla\n",
    "\n",
    "Nikola Tesla was an inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist who is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern `alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. Over ~~200~~300 patents.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The scientists of today think deeply instead of clearly. One must be sane to think clearly, but one can think deeply and be quite insane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tesla was born on the 10th of july 1856 in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia). Tesla died on the 7th of January 1943 at the age fo 86 in New York City, United States.\n",

    "### Tesla coil\n",
    "\n",
    "Tesla found the discoveries of __Heinrich Hertz__ refreshing and decided to repeat the experiment but found that the high frequency current overheated the iron core and melted the insulation between the primary and secondary windings in the coil. To fix this problem Tesla came up with his Tesla coil with an air gap instead of insulating material between the primary and secondary winding and an iron core that could be moved to different positions in or out of the coil. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Wireless lighting\n",
    "\n",
    "Tesla attempted to develop a wireless lighting system based on near-field inductive and capacitive coupling and conducted a series of public demonstrations where he lit Geissler tubes and even incandescent light bulbs from across a stage. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Radio remote control \n",
    "\n",
    "Tesla demonstrated a boat that used a coherer-based radio control--which he dubbed \"telautomaton\"--to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Sqaure Garden. He tried to sell his idea to the U.S. military as a type fo radio-controlled torpedo, but they showed little interest until World War I and afterward, when a number of countries used it in military program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Patents\n",
    "\n",
    "Tesla obtained around ~~280~~300 patents worldwide for his inventions. Many inventions developed by Tesla were not put into patent protection. \n",
